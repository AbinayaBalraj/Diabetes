Diabetes Prediction

Introduction
Diabetes is a chronic disease that occurs when the pancreas is no longer able to make insulin, or when the body cannot make good use of the insulin it produces. Machine learning techniques, particularly SVM, can be utilized to predict diabetes based on various factors such as glucose levels, blood pressure, etc.

This project aims to build a predictive model using SVM to classify whether a patient has diabetes or not based on certain features.

Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the Diabetes Database from Kaggle. It contains various features such as number of pregnancies, glucose concentration, blood pressure, skin thickness, insulin, BMI, diabetes pedigree function, and age.

Results
The SVM model is trained on the dataset and evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The performance of the model is analyzed and visualized using appropriate plots.
